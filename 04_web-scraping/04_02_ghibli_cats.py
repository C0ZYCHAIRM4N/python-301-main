# Read through the documentation of the Ghibli API and reproduce the example
# listed at https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/#section/Use-Case in Python.
# Try skim the Haskell code example and see if you can understand anything.
# Don't worry if you don't, it's a completely different language :)

# Your task is to use the API to find information about all the cats that
# appear in Studio Ghibli films.
